      <div class="title">i was ok before</div>
      <p>my inner thoughts and worries from this and last year</p>
      <div class="content">
          <p>note the word "before".</p>
          <p>right now, i am sitting in the communal room of my suite. the <span class="hiddentxt"><a href="kitchen.jpeg">kitchen</a></span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="kitchen.jpeg" width="250" /></span> is to the left of me, a <span class="hiddentxt"><a href="mural.jpeg">mural</a></span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="mural.jpeg" width="250" /></span> on canvas painted by one of my suitemates hanging on the right. it is currently 2:57 A.M. this is the standard time that i should be sleeping instead of typing this. but i digress, because i don't sleep and my usual sleeping time ranges from 5 AM to never. i sit on a (very) uncomfortable chair in front of two square-shaped dining tables that have seen better days. my back curls like an unpeeled <span class="hiddentxt"><a href="shrimp.jpeg">shrimp</a></span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="shrimp.jpeg" width="250" /></span>. i bite my tongue and it hurts but i keep doing it because i collect bad habits at a faster rate than bottle caps (although there is a correlation between the two. trust me on this). i <span class="hiddentxt"><a href="me.jpeg">blink</a></span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="me.jpeg" width="250" /></span> and my eyes scream in agony for me to sleep (but i know that if i do, i will oversleep).</p>
          <p>i think i might have insommnia. <em>do</em> i have insommnia? my dad and my grandpa have it. do i have to take melatonin? my roommate tells me its very effective but my mom discourages me, saying that i will get addicted (she's probably right).</p>
          <p>i feel the life draining from me as i am typing this. a sliver of it that i didn't know i still had. i am weightless and heavy at the same time. i am chasing behind work, projects and projects and a bajillion other stuff (thankfully my boss is nice and understands, nodding with a smile as i apologetically explain through a zoom screen why i can't finish my current assigned project before the end of this week).</p>
          <p>how did i get to this point? i was ok before. at least, only a few months ago. i had everything handled. i was on top of things (or at least caught up to things). i don't really know what happened in between.</p>
          <p>i should stop worrying. i should really stop worrying. my parents tell me not to, but i don't think they fully understand: they mean well, but they come from a different generation, different circumstances. i wonder if i can ever fully open myself to someone. not romantically, but maybe as a friend. i am so used to keeping to myself that to open myself and to <em>go outside into the world</em>is still strange to me, even in the middle of this city where i am constantly motivated to go out. it's expected of me.</p>
          <p>i was ok before. maybe i'll be ok again.</p>
