          <p>note the word "before".</p>
          <p>right now, i am sitting in the communal room of my suite. the <span class="hiddentxt"><a href="kitchen.jpeg">kitchen</a></span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="kitchen.jpeg" width="250" /></span> is to the left of me, a <span class="hiddentxt"><a href="mural.jpeg">mural</a></span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="mural.jpeg" width="250" /></span> on canvas painted by one of my suitemates hanging on the right. it is currently 2:57 A.M. this is the standard time that i should be sleeping instead of typing this. but i digress, because i don't sleep and my usual sleeping time ranges from 5 AM to never. i sit on a (very) uncomfortable chair in front of two square-shaped dining tables that have seen better days. my back curls like an unpeeled <span class="hiddentxt"><a href="shrimp.jpeg">shrimp</a></span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="shrimp.jpeg" width="250" /></span>. i bite my tongue and it hurts but i keep doing it because i collect bad habits at a faster rate than bottle caps (although there is a correlation between the two. trust me on this). i <span class="hiddentxt"><a href="me.jpeg">blink</a></span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="me.jpeg" width="250" /></span> and my eyes scream in agony for me to sleep (but i know that if i do, i will oversleep and cry in my pillow for being so stupid and so tired).</p>
          <p>i'm horrible during finals. i feel the life draining from me as i am typing this. a sliver of it that i didn't know i still had. i am falling apart. i am weightless and heavy at the same time. i am behind on my work in several classes. i am behind on my work outside of school (thankfully my boss is nice and understands, nodding with a smile as i apologetically explain through a zoom screen why i can't finish my current assigned project before the end of this week). i am behind.</p>
          <p>how did i get to this point? i was ok before. at least, only a few months ago.</p>
