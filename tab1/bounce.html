            <p>The bouncing DVD Logo, or DVD Screensaver, refers to the animated screensaver commonly found on American DVD players, in which the DVD Video logo bounces to different parts of the screen and changes color. Online and in pop culture, people brag and joke about seeing the logo land perfectly in the corner of the screen.</p>
            <p>At my grandparent’s house, there used to be an old, bulky television that was on its last legs. The only channel that seemed to work at the time was the news.</p>
            <p>When my sister and I would try to insert CDs and play movies to watch on the television, the screensaver would pop up.We’d watch it bouncing back and forth across the screen, hoping that it would hit one of the corners. At the time, there wasn't much else to do. iPads and Cocomelon didn't exist.</p>
