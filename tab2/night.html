          <p>right now it's 1:23 A.M. and i should really be sleeping but i want to say something really random instead of either going to bed or doing work (neither of which i want to do right now).</p>
          <p>it's really random and probably really stupid (bear with me here) but one time i was thinking about the <span class="hiddentxt"><a href="logo.png">bouncing dvd logo.</a></span><span class="hiddenimg"><img src="logo.png" width="250" /></span></p>
          <p>the bouncing dvd logo (or dvd screensaver) is an animated screensaver on american dvd players, that bounces across the screen and changes color when it hits a corner.</p>
          <p>at my grandparent’s house, there used to be an old, bulky television that was on its last legs. the only channel that seemed to work at the time was the news. when my sister and i would try to insert cds, the screensaver would pop up and we’d watch it bouncing back and forth across the screen, hoping that it would hit one of the corners. at the time, there wasn't much else to do. ipads and cocomelon didn't exist then, and life was a lot simpler.</p>
